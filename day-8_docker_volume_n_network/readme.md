# Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data in Docker containers. Volumes allow data to be stored outside of the container's filesystem, ensuring data is preserved even when containers are stopped or removed.

### What is a Docker Volume?

A Docker volume is a storage location that exists outside the container filesystem but is accessible by the container. Volumes are managed by Docker and can be shared between containers or backed up.

### Benefits of Using Docker Volumes

- **Persistence**: Data stored in volumes persists even when the container is deleted or recreated.
- **Isolation**: Volumes provide a mechanism to isolate data from the container itself.
- **Sharing Data**: Volumes allow containers to share data, which is useful when containers need to work with the same data.

### Creating and Using Docker Volumes

#### Creating a Volume

To create a Docker volume, run the following command:

```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```

This will create a volume called `my-volume`. Docker manages this volume, and it exists outside the container’s lifecycle.

#### Using Volumes with Containers

To mount a volume to a container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-container -v my-volume:/app/data my-image
```

This mounts the `my-volume` volume to the `/app/data` directory inside the container. Docker will create the directory if it doesn't exist.

#### Inspecting Volumes

To inspect the details of a volume:

```bash
docker volume inspect my-volume
```

This shows information like the volume’s mount point on the host system.

#### Listing Volumes

To list all available Docker volumes:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

#### Removing Volumes

To remove a volume, use:

```bash
docker volume rm my-volume
```

Note: A volume can only be removed if it is not in use by any container. To remove unused volumes:

```bash
docker volume prune
```

### Types of Volumes

1. **Named Volumes**: These are volumes you create by name and Docker manages them.
2. **Anonymous Volumes**: These are automatically created without a specific name when you don't specify one.
3. **Bind Mounts**: These mount a specific file or directory from the host system into the container.

#### Example with Bind Mounts

```bash
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/app/data my-image
```

### Best Practices for Using Volumes

- **Keep persistent data in volumes** to ensure it’s not lost when containers are removed.
- **Use named volumes** for better management and organization.
- **Backup and restore**: Use Docker volume commands to backup and restore data stored in volumes.

# Docker Networks

Docker networks enable containers to communicate with each other and with the external world. When containers are connected to a network, they can communicate over that network, which is crucial in multi-container setups.

### Types of Docker Networks

Docker provides several types of networks for different use cases:

1. **Bridge Network**
2. **Host Network**
3. **None Network**
4. **Custom Networks**

#### 1. Bridge Network

The default network mode when you create a container is **bridge**. It provides a private internal network for containers, isolated from the host network. Containers connected to a bridge network can communicate with each other, but they cannot directly communicate with the external world without port mapping.

- **Use Case**: Ideal for running containers on a single host.

#### 2. Host Network

In **host** network mode, a container shares the host’s networking namespace. It doesn’t have its own IP address and uses the host’s IP address to communicate with other containers and the outside world.

- **Use Case**: Suitable when you need containers to have the same networking performance as the host, without the isolation of the bridge network.

#### 3. None Network

The **none** network mode disables all networking for the container. The container cannot communicate with the outside world or other containers.

- **Use Case**: Useful for highly isolated containers or when you need to configure networking manually.

#### 4. Custom Networks

You can create custom networks for more complex networking scenarios. Docker allows you to create your own networks using the following command:

```bash
docker network create --driver <driver_name> my-custom-network
```

The most common drivers are:
- **bridge**: Creates an isolated network.
- **overlay**: Enables communication between containers on different Docker hosts (used with Docker Swarm).
- **macvlan**: Assigns a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.

- **Use Case**: Best for multi-host Docker setups, where containers need to span across multiple machines.

### Network Drivers

Docker supports different types of network drivers for different purposes:

- **bridge**: The default network driver, creates an isolated network on a single host.
- **host**: Uses the host network directly.
- **overlay**: Creates a distributed network that works across multiple Docker hosts.
- **macvlan**: Provides containers with unique MAC addresses, as if they were physical devices on a network.
- **none**: No networking at all, used for isolated containers.

### Managing Docker Networks

#### Creating a Network

To create a custom bridge network:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my-network
```

To create an overlay network:

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay my-overlay-network
```

#### Listing Networks

To view all Docker networks:

```bash
docker network ls
```

#### Inspecting a Network

To inspect a network’s details:

```bash
docker network inspect my-network
```

#### Removing a Network

To remove a network:

```bash
docker network rm my-network
```

### Connecting and Disconnecting Containers from Networks

You can connect a container to a network during its creation:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-container --network my-network my-image
```

To connect an existing container to a network:

```bash
docker network connect my-network my-container
```

To disconnect a container from a network:

```bash
docker network disconnect my-network my-container
```

### DNS Resolution in Docker Networks

Docker networks provide automatic DNS resolution for containers. If two containers are on the same network, they can refer to each other by container name (e.g., `my-container`), rather than IP address.

### Network Modes in Docker Compose

In Docker Compose, you can define custom networks for multi-container applications. For example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    networks:
      - my-network
  db:
    image: my-db
    networks:
      - my-network

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge
```

This setup ensures that both the `app` and `db` services are connected to the `my-network` network.

### Best Practices for Docker Networking

- **Use custom networks**: For isolated environments, create custom networks instead of using the default bridge network.
- **Use DNS names for communication**: When containers are on the same network, use container names instead of IP addresses to reference other containers.
- **Avoid unnecessary exposure**: Only expose ports that are necessary to external services.
- **Security**: Use network segmentation to isolate containers based on roles (e.g., frontend, backend).
