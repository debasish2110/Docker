# Docker Architecture

Docker is a containerization platform that enables developers to package applications along with all their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. This document explains the Docker architecture in depth.

## ðŸ§± Components of Docker Architecture

Docker follows a **client-server architecture**, consisting of the following major components:

**How It Works**
- The Docker Client is where users initiate actions (e.g., running a container, building an image).

- The Docker Daemon acts as the server and handles these requests. It runs the actual containers, manages their life cycles, pulls images, etc.

---

### 1. Docker Engine

The **Docker Engine** is the runtime that builds and runs containers. It is made up of three essential parts:

#### a. Docker Client (`docker`)
- The interface through which users interact with Docker.
- Command-line tool that accepts user commands and translates them into Docker API calls.
- Typically interacts with the Docker daemon on the same host, but can also communicate with remote Docker daemons.
- Common commands: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker stop`, `docker ps`, etc.

#### b. Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)
- Acts as the server component of Docker.
- Continuously runs as a background process on the host machine.
- Listens for Docker API requests over a UNIX socket or network interface.
- Responsible for creating, managing, and executing Docker containers.
- Can also manage Docker images, volumes, and networks.
- Can communicate with other Docker daemons to manage Docker services in a distributed manner (used in Docker Swarm).

#### c. Docker REST API
- Defines how the client and other external tools communicate with the Docker daemon.
- Exposes all Docker daemon functionality as a RESTful API.
- Enables integration with third-party tools, dashboards, or orchestrators.

---

### 2. Docker Objects

These are the core entities that Docker uses to encapsulate and manage application environments:

#### a. Images
- A Docker image is a snapshot or blueprint of a container.
- Contains the application code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
- Built using a `Dockerfile`, which is a step-by-step recipe defining how the image should be constructed.
- Images are immutable; each change results in a new image layer.

#### b. Containers
- Containers are instances of Docker images.
- They are created and started by the Docker daemon.
- Containers are isolated environments with their own filesystem, process space, and network stack.
- Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and fast compared to virtual machines.
- Containers can be ephemeral or persistent depending on configuration.

#### c. Volumes
- Used for persistent storage in Docker.
- Allow data to persist across container restarts or be shared between multiple containers.
- Managed by the Docker daemon.
- Volumes are stored outside the containerâ€™s writable layer to ensure separation of concerns.

#### d. Networks
- Provide connectivity between containers and to the external world.
- Docker creates a default bridge network, but users can define custom bridge, overlay, macvlan, or host networks.
- Networks allow for container service discovery and communication without manual IP management.

### 3. Docker Registries

Docker registries are repositories where Docker images are stored and distributed.

- **Public Registries**: Docker Hub is the default and widely used public registry. Anyone can push or pull images.
- **Private Registries**: Organizations can host their own registries (e.g., AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry) for internal use.
- **Operations**:
  - `docker pull <image>`: Downloads an image from a registry.
  - `docker push <image>`: Uploads a locally built image to a registry.

---

## ðŸ”„ How It Works: End-to-End Flow

1. **Build**: The developer writes a `Dockerfile` containing the application blueprint. Using `docker build`, Docker converts this file into an image.
2. **Store**: The built image is either stored locally or pushed to a remote registry (e.g., Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
3. **Distribute**: Any machine with Docker installed can pull the image using `docker pull`, ensuring environment consistency across dev, test, and prod.
4. **Run**: A container is created and started from the image using `docker run`. Docker allocates system resources (namespaces, cgroups) and starts the container process.
5. **Manage**: Docker provides tools and commands to list (`docker ps`), inspect (`docker inspect`), stop (`docker stop`), and remove (`docker rm`) containers.
6. **Persist**: Volumes are attached using the `-v` flag or via Docker Compose to ensure data is not lost when containers are stopped or deleted.
7. **Connect**: Containers can communicate internally over defined networks, and services can be exposed to the host or internet using port mappings (`-p 8080:80`).
